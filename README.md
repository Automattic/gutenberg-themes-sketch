# Gutenberg Sketch Files

This repository hosts a set of [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com) files that are built to help you design WordPress themes with the block-based [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/) editor in mind.

The symbols in these files allow you to easily edit and customize styles for all of the default Gutenberg blocks. This makes it easy to iterate on styling blocks for themes, and can help you design in a more modular way. 

There's an [introductory post on Themeshaper](https://themeshaper.com/2018/03/07/designing-gutenberg-block-driven-themes-with-sketch/) that shows one example of a workflow, but we encourage you to experiment and share what works for you.

PRs and enhancements welcome!

## Files

There are two files in this repo: 

1. **Gutenberg Block Symbols.sketch** / A single file with [symbols](https://sketchapp.com/docs/symbols/) and [text styles](https://sketchapp.com/docs/text/text-styles/) for every standard Gutenberg Block. 
2. **Gutenberg Block Library.sketch** / Those same symbols, but in a Sketch Library file. This lets you reuse styles across multiple files.
